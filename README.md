## Stack implementation in C++

This repository contains a simple implementation of a stack data structure in C++.

# Introduction

The Stack class is a generic implementation of a stack data structure in C++. It allows you to create a stack, push elements onto it, pop elements off it, check if it's empty, get the top element, and get the size of the stack.

# Features

- Generic stack implementation for any data type.
- Basic stack operations: push, pop, top, isEmpty, and size.

# Usage

For usage examples, check out "main.cpp." The file contains straightforward examples illustrating how to use each method in the Stack class.
